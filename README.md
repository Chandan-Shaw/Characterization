# IC-Characterization
- This GitHub repository is created to provide hands-on experience in Analog IC Characterization using open-source tools such as **NGSpice**, **Xschem**, and the **SKY130 PDK**.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## What Is Analog Characterization ?
Analog IC (Integrated Circuit) Characterization is the process of evaluating and measuring the electrical performance of an analog circuit under various conditions. This involves testing key parameters such as gain, offset, bandwidth, noise, power consumption, input/output impedance, temperature stability, and process variation sensitivity.

Characterization is carried out using tools like Ngspice, Eldo (Simulation) and Xschem (Schematic) providing a complete framework for accurate simulation and analysis of analog circuits.

Characterization is usually performed post-design (pre- and post-fabrication) to ensure the circuit behaves as intended across different corners:

- Process Corners: Variations in manufacturing (e.g., TT, FF, SS).

- Voltage Corners: Operating at min/max supply voltages.

- Temperature Corners: Measuring across temperature range (e.g., -40°C to 125°C).

 ## 1. Basic Concept

 ### 1.1 Charge
  The most basic quantity in an electric circuit is the electric charge.
  
  Charge is an **Electric Property** of an atomic particle of which matter consists, measured in **Coulombs** (C).
  
  The Coulomb is a large unit of charge. ``1C = 1 / 1.602 * 10^-19 =  6.24 * 10^-18``  

 ### 1.2 Current
  The electric current due to the flow of electronic charge in a conductor.

  Electric Current is the time rate of change of Charge,measured in **Ampere** (A).

  Mathematically - `` i = dq/dt ``
 
  ( 1 Ampere = 1 Coulomb/1Second )

 ### 1.3 Voltage
  Voltage is the energy required to move a unit charge from a reference point(-) to another point (+), measured in
  **Volts (V).**

  Voltage between two pont a & b is as:  `` Vab = dw/dq ``  ( 1 Volt = 1 Joule/Coulomb )

  **Vab = -Vba** (Voltage drops from a to b is equivalent to voltage rise from b to a )

 ### 1.4 Power
  Power is the time rate of expanding or absorbing energy, measured is **Watts (W).**

  Mathematically , `` p = dw/dt `` (1 Watt = 1 Joule/1Second)

  where p is **power**, w is **energy** in Joules and t is the **time** in seconds.

  `` p = vi `` , is a time varing quantity and is called **Instantaneous Power.**

  The power absorbed or supplied by an element is the product of the voltage across the element and the current          through it.

 ### 1.5 Energy
  Energy is the capacity to do work, measured in **Joules (J).**

  Energy is an electric circuit is defined as the total power consumption in a period (From time t0 to t)

  Mathematically ,  w = $\int_{t_0}^{t} p \ dt$ = $\int_{t_0}^{t} vi \ dt$  

  The electric power utility companies measures energy in Watt-hour (Wh) , Where `` 1 Wh = 3600 J `` 
 ## 2. Linear Element
  
 ### 2.1 Resistor
  A resistor is an passive electrical component that opposes the flow of electric current.

  The resistance value is measured in **Ohms (Ω)**

  Given by Ohm’s Law:   `` V=I×R `` 
  
  **Used of Resistor**
   - Its main use is to limit or control the flow of electric current in a circuit.
   - To set biasing in amplifiers

 ### 2.2 Capacitors
 A capacitor is a passive electrical component that stores energy in the form of an electric field, defined by the relation: `` Q = C * V ``, where C is the capacitance in **Farads**.

 The capacitance C of a parallel-plate capacitor depends on its physical structure and the material between the plates, given by the formula: `` C = εA / d ``.

 In the **Skywater SKY130 PDK**, various capacitor types are available for use in analog, RF, and digital designs, each offering trade-offs in capacitance density, linearity, voltage rating, and            temperature stability.

 ### Types of Capacitors available:
  - ``sky130_fd_pr__cap_mim_m3_1.model`` is a **Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM)** capacitor between **Metal3 and                  Metal2**, suitable for analog precision applications.
  - ``sky130_fd_pr__cap_mim_m3_2.model`` is another **MIM** capacitor variant with different area usage and                   parasitic trade-offs.
  - ``sky130_fd_pr__cap_mim_m2_1.model`` defines a MIM capacitor between **Metal2 and Metal1** layers.
  - ``sky130_fd_pr__cap_var_lvt.model`` is a **MOS varactor** (voltage-dependent capacitor) built using LVT NMOS              structure, useful for RF tuning.
  - ``sky130_fd_pr__cap_var_hvt.model`` is a similar **varactor** using HVT device for different threshold and                leakage behavior.

  ### 2.3 RC Circuit
  - An RC circuit is an electrical circuit made of **R — Resistor** & **C — Capacitor** connected either in series or parallel, which exhibit a time-dependent response to voltage or current changes. The     fundamental time constant is defined as:  
    `τ = R * C`, where `τ` (tau) represents the **time constant** in seconds, indicating how quickly the circuit charges or discharges.
  - In the **Skywater SKY130 PDK**, **RC circuits** are implemented using integrated resistors (e.g.,`sky130_fd_pr__res_high_po`) and capacitors (e.g.,`sky130_fd_pr__cap_mim_m3_1`). These are critical in    analog and mixed-signal design applications such as filters, timing circuits, and analog front ends.

  ### 2.4 CR Circuit
  - A **Cr circuit** is essentially the same as an RC circuit, but with the capacitor (C) placed before the resistor (R) in the signal path. While electrically the time constant remains the same, the        circuit response differs, especially in transient analysis. The fundamental time constant is defined as: `τ = R * C`,
  where `τ` (tau) represents the **time constant** in seconds, indicating how quickly the circuit charges or discharges.

  - In the **Skywater SKY130 PDK**, **CR circuits** are implemented using integrated capacitors (e.g., `sky130_fd_pr__cap_mim_m3_1`) and resistors (e.g., `sky130_fd_pr__res_high_po`). These configurations   are often used in differentiator circuits, pulse shaping, and AC coupling applications in analog and RF systems.

 ## 3. MOSFET Circuits
 - A MOSFET(Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) has four terminal device:- Gate, Drain, Source, Body.
 - MOSFET is device used for switching and amplification, Its current is controlled by the voltage applied to the gate terminal.
 - The MOSFET operates in three regions: **cutoff, linear, and saturation**, depending on gate-source (VGS) and drain-source (VDS) voltages.
 - In the Skywater SKY130 PDK, MOSFETs like ``sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8`` (NMOS) and ``sky130_fd_pr__pfet_01v8`` (PMOS) are commonly used. These are essential in digital logic, analog amplifiers, and
 switching applications.
 
 
   
  ## 1. CMOS
  
  ### What Is CMOS ?
  CMOS (Complementary Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor) is a technology used to build most modern digital chips — like
  processors, memory, and logic circuits.

  CMOS is a semiconductor technology that uses complementary NMOS and PMOS transistors to build low-power, high-speed
  digital and analog circuits.
  
  It Uses two types OF MOSFET Operation:
  - **PMOS(Positive Type)**
  - **NMOS(Negative Type)**
    
  They work together in a CMOS: - When one is **ON** then Other is **OFF.**

  ### Why CMOS is important ?
  - Very Low Power Consumption
  - High Speed
  - High Packing Density ( Many Circuits on a small Chip. )
  - Reliability

    It is used in like ***Microprocessors***,***Smartphone***,***Digital Logic Circuits***,***Memory Chips.***


  ## Simple Current Mirror

  - A current mirror is an analog circuit that copies (or "mirrors") a reference current from one branch of a circuit into another branch, maintaining a constant output current regardless of the load resistance (within limits).
  - It’s widely used in biasing circuits, active loads, and current-mode logic.
  - Implemented using matched transistors (BJTs or MOSFETs).
  - Key Idea : If two transistors are perfectly matched and have the same VGS then they will conduct the same drain/collector current.
  ### Advantages
  - Accurate current replication (when devices are matched and well-designed).
  - High output impedance - good for biasing and active loads.
  - Compact design — no need for large resistors.
  - Scalable — easy to generate multiple identical or scaled currents.
  - Temperature tracking — matched devices track each other’s thermal changes.
  ### Disadvantages
  - Device mismatch causes current errors.
  - Finite output resistance leads to current variation.
  - Voltage headroom requirement (especially in cascode types).
  -  Temperature dependence — though better than resistors, still affected.
  - Limited accuracy at very low currents due to leakage and mismatch.

 ## Single Stage Amplifiers
 - A single-stage amplifier is the simplest form of amplifier — it uses just one active device (like a BJT, MOSFET, or JFET) along with biasing and load components to amplify a weak input signal into a stronger output signal.
 - The term single stage means the signal passes through only one amplifying device before reaching the output.

 ### Advantages
 - Simple design — easy to understand and build.
 - Low cost — fewer components.
 - Foundation for multi-stage amplifiers.

 ### Disadvantages
 - Limited gain — can’t amplify very weak signals to large values in one stage.
 - Lower input/output impedance control — may not match all sources/loads.
 - Limited bandwidth — affected by transistor parasitics and load capacitance.
 - Noisy — more susceptible to noise compared to differential stages
