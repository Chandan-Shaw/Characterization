## What Is Analog Characterization ?

- Analog IC (Integrated Circuit) Characterization is the process of evaluating and measuring the electrical performance of an analog circuit under various conditions. This involves testing key parameters such as gain, offset, bandwidth, noise, power consumption, input/output impedance, temperature stability, and process variation sensitivity.
