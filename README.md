## What Is Analog Characterization ?

- Analog IC (Integrated Circuit) Characterization is the process of evaluating and measuring the electrical performance of an analog circuit under various conditions. This involves testing key parameters such as gain, offset, bandwidth, noise, power consumption, input/output impedance, temperature stability, and process variation sensitivity.

  ### What Is CMOS ?
  CMOS (Complementary Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor) is a technology used to build most modern digital chips — like
  processors, memory, and logic circuits.

  CMOS is a semiconductor technology that uses complementary NMOS and PMOS transistors to build low-power, high-speed
  digital and analog circuits.
  
  It Uses two types OF MOSFET Operation:
  - **PMOS(Positive Type)**
  - **NMOS(Negative Type)**
    
  They work together in a CMOS: - When one is **ON** then Other is **OFF.**

  ### Why CMOS is important ?
  - Very Low Power Consumption
  - High Speed
  - High Packing Density ( Many Circuits on a small Chip. )
  - Reliability

    It is used in like ***Microprocessors***,***Smartphone***,***Digital Logic Circuits***,***Memory Chips.***
